- Plug the arduino into the computer using the serial cable
- Download Arduino IDE
- Connect the different components (Acc+Gyro, Magnetometer, Ultrasonic sensor) to the arduino by following the physical schema of the prototype
- Open up the files in Arduino IDE
- Compile the code and run it on the arduino
- You can see the results by showing the serial monitor with 115200 bauds
